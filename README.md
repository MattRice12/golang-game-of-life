  I. Structure:
    1. Get single cell to alternate through life and death

    2. Get a single row working. Cell[0] is alive on first run, Cell[1] alive, Cell[0] dead on second run. Repeat down the row for each run.

    3. Get rows and columns to light up; simple rules.

  II. Rules:
    1. Implement simple rules (May already be completed by I.3.)

    2. Implement complex rules
